# First-Vue
The repository used to record building a vue app with unit test
I forgot to record my first experience of building the app and now I have to do it again recording the process, intervals between submissons seeming unreasonably short consequently.

Some files are ignored by .gitignore
# first-vue

> Actually the second vue project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
